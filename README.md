# SARSA_VS_ExpectedSARSA
A project realized in a team of 2, where we implemented the SARSA and Expected SARSA RL agents from scratch. We then tested and compared their performances on the Frozen Lake gym environment, and experimented with their hyperparameters to see how they can affect an agent's performance.
